# My First Blog Post

Welcome to my blog! This is my first post, and I'm excited to share it with you.

## Introduction

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Here are some of the basics:

- **Bold** text is created with double asterisks (`**bold**`).
- *Italic* text is created with single asterisks (`*italic*`).
- Lists are created with dashes or asterisks:
  - Item 1
  - Item 2
  - Item 3

## Code Examples

You can include code blocks using triple backticks. Hereâ€™s an example of Python code:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")

hello_world()
